# Tool Usability Review and Recommendations

This report provides a review of the Atlassian MCP tools for Confluence and Jira, with a focus on improving their clarity and usability for Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to reduce ambiguity and make it easier for an LLM to select the correct tool for a given task.

## Confluence Tools Analysis

The Confluence toolset is comprehensive and well-structured. The main areas for improvement are in differentiating between tools with similar names or overlapping functionality.

### 1. `get_confluence_user` vs. `find_confluence_users`

- **Issue:** Potential confusion between getting a specific user and searching for users.
- **Recommendation:** Add more explicit guidance to the descriptions.

  - **`get_confluence_user` description:**
    > "Get details for a specific Confluence user by a unique identifier like username, account ID, or email. Returns user profile information. **Use this tool when you are confident you can uniquely identify a user.**"

  - **`find_confluence_users` description:**
    > "Searches for Confluence users based on various criteria. This is useful for finding user details like account IDs when you have partial information or need to perform a broader search. **Use this tool when you need to find users based on a query.**"

### 2. `search_confluence_pages_by_user` vs. `list_user_confluence_pages`

- **Issue:** Similar names make it hard to distinguish between searching by involvement and listing by creation.
- **Recommendation:** Make the names more descriptive.

  - **`search_confluence_pages_by_user`:**
    - **New Name:** `search_pages_by_user_involvement`
    - **New Description:** "Search pages based on a user's involvement, such as being the creator or last modifier. Can filter by creator, last modifier, or both."

  - **`list_user_confluence_pages`:**
    - **New Name:** `list_pages_created_by_user`
    - **New Description:** "List all pages created by a specific user, with optional filtering by space or time range."

### 3. `list_user_confluence_attachments` vs. `list_confluence_attachments`

- **Issue:** Similar names for listing attachments by user and by page.
- **Recommendation:** Make the names more descriptive.

  - **`list_user_confluence_attachments`:**
    - **New Name:** `list_attachments_uploaded_by_user`
    - **New Description:** "List all attachments uploaded by a specific user, with optional filtering by space."

  - **`list_confluence_attachments`:**
    - **New Name:** `list_attachments_on_page`
    - **New Description:** "Lists all attachments for a specific Confluence page. Can be filtered by filename or media type."

### 4. `read_confluence_page` vs. `download_confluence_page_complete` vs. `export_confluence_page`

- **Issue:** Overlapping functionality between reading, downloading, and exporting a page.
- **Recommendation:** Clarify the primary use case for each tool in the description and rename `download_confluence_page_complete`.

  - **`read_confluence_page` description:**
    > "Retrieves the content of a Confluence page... **Use this for quickly reading the text content of a page.**"

  - **`download_confluence_page_complete`:**
    - **New Name:** `get_page_with_attachments`
    - **New Description:** "Performs a comprehensive download of a Confluence page, including its full content, metadata, and optionally, all of its attachments... **Use this when you need the page content, metadata, and all associated attachments.**"

  - **`export_confluence_page` description:**
    > "Exports a Confluence page to either HTML or Markdown format... **Use this when you want to create a portable, self-contained file of a page.**"

## Jira Tools Analysis

The Jira toolset is also robust and well-designed. The recommendations are similar to the Confluence tools, focusing on more explicit descriptions and clearer naming.

### 1. `search_jira_issues_by_user` vs. `list_user_jira_issues`

- **Issue:** Similar names for searching by involvement and listing by role.
- **Recommendation:** Make the names more descriptive.

  - **`search_jira_issues_by_user`:**
    - **New Name:** `search_issues_by_user_involvement`
    - **New Description:** "Search for issues based on a user's involvement, such as being the assignee, reporter, creator, or watcher."

  - **`list_user_jira_issues`:**
    - **New Name:** `list_issues_by_user_role`
    - **New Description:** "List issues where a user has a specific role (assignee, reporter, or creator), with the option to filter by a date range."

### 2. `get_user_jira_activity`

- **Issue:** The term "activity" can be ambiguous.
- **Recommendation:** Provide more examples in the description.

  - **`get_user_jira_activity` description:**
    > "Get a stream of recent user activity, such as issue comments, status changes, and field updates. Can filter by activity type and project."

### 3. `create_jira_issue` (`customFields` parameter)

- **Issue:** The `customFields` parameter can be difficult to use without an example.
- **Recommendation:** Add an example to the parameter description.

  - **`customFields` parameter description:**
    > 'A JSON object for setting custom fields. The keys are the custom field IDs (e.g., "customfield_10010") and the values are the data to be set. **For example: `{"customfield_10010": "Value for custom field"}`**.'

By implementing these recommendations, the Atlassian MCP toolset will be more intuitive and easier for LLMs to use effectively.
